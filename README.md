## How it works

### High level

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    actor User
    participant PWA
    participant API
    participant OpenAI

    PWA ->> API: Ask for conversations
    activate API
    API ->> API: Get conversations from storage
    API ->> PWA: Answer with conversations
    deactivate API
    User ->> PWA: Select a conversation
    User ->> PWA: Insert a message
    PWA ->> API: Send the message
    activate API
    API ->> OpenAI: Ask for a completion
    activate OpenAI
    OpenAI ->> API: Send completion
    deactivate OpenAI
    API ->> API: Save conversation and message
    API ->> PWA: Answer with the message
    deactivate API
    User ->> PWA: See results
```

## How to use

### Run locally

Create a local configuration file, a file named `config.toml` at the root of the project. The TOML file can be placed anywhere in the folder or in any parent directory.

```toml
# config.toml
# /!\ All the file values are for example, you must change them
[api]
# root_path = "[api-path]"

[oidc]
algorithms = ["RS256"]
api_audience = "[aad_app_id]"

```

Now, you can either run the application as container or with live reload. For development, it is recommended to use live reload. For demo, it is recommended to use the container.

With live reload:

```bash
# In each "src/[...]" directory, example "src/conversation-api"
make install start
```

As container:

```bash
make build start logs
```

Then, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081).
