# Employee communication with Private GPT – AI-powered chatbot you can trust

> 👋🏻 Demo available at [private-gpt.shopping-cart-devops-demo.lesne.pro](https://private-gpt.shopping-cart-devops-demo.lesne.pro).

Private GPT is a local version of Chat GPT, using Azure OpenAI. It is an enterprise grade platform to deploy a ChatGPT-like interface for your employees.

Includes:

- Can be configured to use any Azure OpenAI completion API, including GPT-4
- Dark theme for better readability
- Dead simple interface
- Deployable on any Kubernetes cluster, with its Helm chart
- Manage users effortlessly with OpenID Connect
- Monitoring with Azure App Insights (logs, traces, user behaviors)
- More than 150 tones and personalities (accountant, advisor, debater, excel sheet, instructor, logistician, etc.) to better help employees in their specific daily tasks
- Plug and play storage system, including [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/), [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) and [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant).
- Possibility to send temporary messages, for confidentiality
- Salable system based on stateless APIs, cache, progressive web app and events
- Search engine for conversations, based on semantic similarity and AI embeddings
- Unlimited conversation history and number of users
- Usage tracking, for better understanding of your employees' usage

## How it works

### High level

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    actor User
    participant PWA
    participant API
    participant OpenAI

    PWA ->> API: Ask for conversations
    activate API
    API ->> API: Get conversations from storage
    API ->> PWA: Answer with conversations
    deactivate API
    User ->> PWA: Select a conversation
    User ->> PWA: Insert a message
    PWA ->> API: Send the message
    activate API
    API ->> OpenAI: Ask for a completion
    activate OpenAI
    OpenAI ->> API: Send completion
    deactivate OpenAI
    API ->> API: Save conversation and message
    API ->> PWA: Answer with the message
    deactivate API
    User ->> PWA: See results
```

### Architecture

```mermaid

## How to use

### Run locally

Create a local configuration file, a file named `config.toml` at the root of the project. The TOML file can be placed anywhere in the folder or in any parent directory.

```toml
# config.toml
# /!\ All the file values are for example, you must change them
[api]
# root_path = "[api-path]"

[oidc]
algorithms = ["RS256"]
api_audience = "[aad_app_id]"
issuers = ["https://login.microsoftonline.com/[tenant_id]/v2.0"]
jwks = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys"

[monitoring]

[monitoring.logging]
app_level = "DEBUG" # Enum: "NOSET", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL", "CRITICAL"
sys_level = "WARN" # Enum: "NOSET", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL", "CRITICAL"

[monitoring.azure_app_insights]
connection_str = "InstrumentationKey=[key];[...]"

[persistence]
cache = "redis" # Enum: "redis"
search = "qdrant" # Enum: "qdrant"
store = "cosmos" # Enum: "redis", "cosmos"
stream = "redis" # Enum: "redis"

[persistence.qdrant]
host = "[host]"

[persistence.redis]
db = 0
host = "[host]"

[persistence.cosmos]
# Containers "conversation" (/user_id), "message" (/conversation_id), "user" (/dummy), "usage" (/user_id) must exist
url = "https://[deployment].documents.azure.com:443"
database = "[db_name]"

[ai]

[ai.openai]
ada_deploy_id = "ada"
ada_max_tokens = 2049
api_base = "https://[deployment].openai.azure.com"
gpt_deploy_id = "gpt"
gpt_max_tokens = 4096

[ai.azure_content_safety]
api_base = "https://[deployment].cognitiveservices.azure.com"
api_token = "[api_token]"
max_length = 1000

[tools]

[tools.azure_form_recognizer]
api_base = "https://[deployment].cognitiveservices.azure.com"
api_token = "[api_token]"

[tools.bing]
search_url = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search"
subscription_key = "[api_token]"

[tools.tmdb]
bearer_token = "[jwt_token]"

[tools.news]
api_key = "[api_token]"

[tools.listen_notes]
api_key = "[api_token]"
```

Now, you can either run the application as container or with live reload. For development, it is recommended to use live reload. For demo, it is recommended to use the container.

With live reload:

```bash
# In each "src/[...]" directory, example "src/conversation-api"
make install start
```

As container:

```bash
make build start logs
```

Then, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081).

### Deploy locally
